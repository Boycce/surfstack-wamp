Compatibility
-------------
- The \amp\app folder holds official binaries so the contents of each folder
can be replaced with binaries downloaded from original vendor (manually
configuration may need to take place after replacing the files)
- The \amp\config folder holds custom configurations for the applications
- Each configuration has variables which are replaced by values provided by
SSWamp.exe
- Any changes made to the configurations will apply the next time MySQL, Nginx,
PHP, Apache are started

Technical Notes

Website Simulation
------------------
To simulate a domain like www.example.com, add the domain name to your system hosts file to view it locally:

1. Copy C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts to your desktop
2. Open the hosts file in Notepad
3. Add the following lines to the bottom of the hosts file:
4. 127.0.0.1  example.com
5. 127.0.0.1  www.example.com
6. Save the modified hosts file
7. Copy the modified hosts file back to: C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
8. Close your web browser if open
9. Run SSWamp.exe
10. Place a check next to the Apache option
11. Click Turn On Server(s)
12. Test the configuration by opening your web browser to: http://example.com

Quick Solutions
---------------
- Unblock all files on Windows Vista or Windows 7 if prompted
- Allow Apache, Nginx, MySQL, MongoDB, Memcached, and SSWamp.exe through the
firewall if prompted
